# SOLGACOM SERVER 

This is the part in charge of the backend of the Solgacom application. The application is developed using Node js [Node Documentation](https://nodejs.org/es/docs/).

## Install Node

---

If you don't have installed Node js install it at the following link [Install Node js](https://nodejs.org/es/download/) 

## Local Test

---

To start with the application, it is necessary that it be tested together with the Solgacom server [Github Repo](https://github.com/solganeo/solgacomServer).

Once the server application is launched, we execute the following command:

``npm run dev``

This command will execute our application

## Git Workflow

---

There are 2 main branches in the projet:

1. main
2. develop

Every developer has their own branch called **features-developername** where it will make its modifications locally to later make a merge request to **develop** branch

If you don't know how to make this process, please contact r.zuniga@solganeo.com or check the following documentation [Branch WorkFlow git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows).
